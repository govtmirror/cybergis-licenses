### CyberGIS
The Humanitarian Information Unit has been developing a sophisticated geographic computing infrastructure referred to as the CyberGIS. The CyberGIS provides highly available, scalable, reliable, and timely geospatial services capable of supporting multiple concurrent projects.  The CyberGIS relies on primarily open source projects, such as PostGIS, GeoServer, GDAL, OGR, and OpenLayers.  The name CyberGIS is dervied from the term geospatial cyberinfrastructure.

### Imagery to the Crowd
The Humanitarian Information Unit through the [Imagery to the Crowd](https://hiu.state.gov/ittc/ittc.aspx) initiative provides high-resolution commercial satellite imagery services for humanitarian purposes.  Additionally, HIU is working to grow the base of the volunteers contributing open data to OpenStreetMap through the [Mapgive](http://mapgive.state.gov/) campagin.
